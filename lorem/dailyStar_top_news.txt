<p>An arresting exhibition from activist charity Project Pressure uses conceptual photography to capture the decline of the ice caps</p><p>‘What is it about those melting glaciers and desperate polar bears that makes us want to look away?” the activist and author Naomi Klein <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/02/naomi-klein-why-do-we-look-away-from-the-horror-of-climate-change" title="">asked in 2015</a>. In her book <em>This Changes Everything</em>, she laid the blame on powerful global corporations and acquiescent governments, which both simultaneously underplay the scale of the climate emergency and exploit our collective sense of helplessness in the face of it. Since then, a new urgency has driven climate activism, most successfully in the disruptive protests of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion" title="">Extinction Rebellion</a>. Can art, though, have a meaningful role in raising awareness of that urgency?</p><p>A forthcoming exhibition, <a href="https://www.horniman.ac.uk/visit/upcoming-exhibitions/meltdown-visualizing-climate-change#image-0" title="">Meltdown: Visualising Climate Change</a>, at the Horniman Museum in London sets out to answer that question in the affirmative.

These new rules were meant to protect our privacy. They don’t work | Stephanie Hare
The data protection laws introduced last year are failing us – and our children<p>Who owns your data?

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg hewed closely to the Obama playbook in making a case for his candidacy, and his Iowa speech seems likely to boost him in the polls at just the moment when the other leading candidates are showing some worrisome weaknesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/is-pete-buttigiegs-version-of-hope-and-change-enough-to-take-on-trump">Continue reading...</a>

Divided Cities: inside the new documentary series from Guardian Cities
<p>Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more divided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these divisions in surprising and troubling ways<br></p><p>Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p><p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html">now there are 15</a>. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/06/divided-cities-inside-the-new-documentary-series-from-guardian-cities">Continue reading...</a>

John Bercow: ‘I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic’
<p>What next for John Bercow – Speaker for 10 years, and a household name thanks to Brexit? One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg hewed closely to the Obama playbook in making a case for his candidacy, and his Iowa speech seems likely to boost him in the polls at just the moment when the other leading candidates are showing some worrisome weaknesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/is-pete-buttigiegs-version-of-hope-and-change-enough-to-take-on-trump">Continue reading...</a>

Divided Cities: inside the new documentary series from Guardian Cities
<p>Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more divided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these divisions in surprising and troubling ways<br></p><p>Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p><p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html">now there are 15</a>. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/06/divided-cities-inside-the-new-documentary-series-from-guardian-cities">Continue reading...</a>

John Bercow: ‘I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic’
<p>What next for John Bercow – Speaker for 10 years, and a household name thanks to Brexit? One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>

Donald Trump Jr wants to trigger and expose liberals, and they’re letting him | Poppy Noor
<p>A war of words on The View showed the president’s opponents falling straight into his son’s trap</p><p>Last night, ABC’s The View invited Donald Trump Jr on as a guest – because having just one child of a famous politician on the show is not enough (the co-host Meghan McCain is the daughter of the late senator John McCain).

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg hewed closely to the Obama playbook in making a case for his candidacy, and his Iowa speech seems likely to boost him in the polls at just the moment when the other leading candidates are showing some worrisome weaknesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/is-pete-buttigiegs-version-of-hope-and-change-enough-to-take-on-trump">Continue reading...</a>

Divided Cities: inside the new documentary series from Guardian Cities
<p>Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more divided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these divisions in surprising and troubling ways<br></p><p>Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p><p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html">now there are 15</a>. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/06/divided-cities-inside-the-new-documentary-series-from-guardian-cities">Continue reading...</a>
‘Make Spain great again’: does Melilla really need a Trump-style wall? – video
<p>Everyone in Melilla has some connection to the city’s most visible and controversial feature: a huge barbed-wire fence, which separates this Spanish port city from the rest of north Africa. Asylum seekers like Aboubacar wait for months in hidden forest camps to scale the fence, populist politicians like Jesús want to strengthen it, and both the Moroccan and Melillan economy depend on the 30,000 Moroccans like Youssra who cross through it every day to work.

Moving stories: inside the book buses changing children's lives
<p>Around the world, mobile library programmes are taking books, educational support and even counselling to communities in serious and urgent need</p><p>Every week, two converted blue buses stocked with children’s books carefully navigate the streets of Kabul, avoiding areas where deadly explosions are common. These travelling libraries stop off at schools in different parts of the city, delivering a wealth of reading material directly to youngsters who have limited access to books.</p><p>“A lot of schools in our city don’t have access to something as basic as a library,” says Freshta Karim, a 27-year-old Oxford University graduate who was inspired to start Charmaghz, a non-profit, in her home city having grown up without many books herself. “We were trying to understand what we could do to promote critical thinking in our country.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/05/moving-stories-inside-the-book-buses-changing-childrens-lives">Continue reading...</a>
John Bercow: ‘I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic’
<p>What next for John Bercow – Speaker for 10 years, and a household name thanks to Brexit? One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>
Unifying message behind this year’s Remembrance Day
The weekend’s events will focus on the shared history of Britain’s communities whose ancestors stood together in conflict<p>As Britain unites to honour its war dead, a campaign to ensure Remembrance Sunday can be celebrated by everyone “irrespective of nationality, creed or colour” has been backed by MPs, and faith community and former military leaders. Called “remember together” and coordinated by the Royal British Legion and thinktank <a href="http://www.britishfuture.org/" title="">British Future</a>, it encourages people from different backgrounds to commemorate their shared history 75 years after major battles <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/d-day-key-facts-on-the-largest-military-operation-ever-attempted" title="">such as D-Day</a>.</p><p>The initiative comes as Labour and the Conservatives use Sunday to launch competing pledges to help veterans.

Not all Africans’ sacrifice is forgotten | Letters
While many African soldiers from the Great War were buried in unmarked graves, a memorial in Malawi pays due tribute<p>I was saddened to read that many of the African soldiers and carriers who served with the British Army in east Africa during the First World War were buried in unmarked graves (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/03/how-britain-dishonoured-first-world-war-african-dead" title="">No graves, no dignity.

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>
Unifying message behind this year’s Remembrance Day
The weekend’s events will focus on the shared history of Britain’s communities whose ancestors stood together in conflict<p>As Britain unites to honour its war dead, a campaign to ensure Remembrance Sunday can be celebrated by everyone “irrespective of nationality, creed or colour” has been backed by MPs, and faith community and former military leaders. Called “remember together” and coordinated by the Royal British Legion and thinktank <a href="http://www.britishfuture.org/" title="">British Future</a>, it encourages people from different backgrounds to commemorate their shared history 75 years after major battles <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/d-day-key-facts-on-the-largest-military-operation-ever-attempted" title="">such as D-Day</a>.</p><p>The initiative comes as Labour and the Conservatives use Sunday to launch competing pledges to help veterans.

Not all Africans’ sacrifice is forgotten | Letters
While many African soldiers from the Great War were buried in unmarked graves, a memorial in Malawi pays due tribute<p>I was saddened to read that many of the African soldiers and carriers who served with the British Army in east Africa during the First World War were buried in unmarked graves (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/03/how-britain-dishonoured-first-world-war-african-dead" title="">No graves, no dignity.

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg hewed closely to the Obama playbook in making a case for his candidacy, and his Iowa speech seems likely to boost him in the polls at just the moment when the other leading candidates are showing some worrisome weaknesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/is-pete-buttigiegs-version-of-hope-and-change-enough-to-take-on-trump">Continue reading...</a>

Divided Cities: inside the new documentary series from Guardian Cities
<p>Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more divided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these divisions in surprising and troubling ways<br></p><p>Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p><p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html">now there are 15</a>. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/06/divided-cities-inside-the-new-documentary-series-from-guardian-cities">Continue reading...</a>

John Bercow: ‘I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic’
<p>What next for John Bercow – Speaker for 10 years, and a household name thanks to Brexit? One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg hewed closely to the Obama playbook in making a case for his candidacy, and his Iowa speech seems likely to boost him in the polls at just the moment when the other leading candidates are showing some worrisome weaknesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/is-pete-buttigiegs-version-of-hope-and-change-enough-to-take-on-trump">Continue reading...</a>

Divided Cities: inside the new documentary series from Guardian Cities
<p>Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more divided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these divisions in surprising and troubling ways<br></p><p>Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p><p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html">now there are 15</a>. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/06/divided-cities-inside-the-new-documentary-series-from-guardian-cities">Continue reading...</a>
‘Make Spain great again’: does Melilla really need a Trump-style wall? – video

John Bercow: ‘I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic’
<p>What next for John Bercow – Speaker for 10 years, and a household name thanks to Brexit? One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg hewed closely to the Obama playbook in making a case for his candidacy, and his Iowa speech seems likely to boost him in the polls at just the moment when the other leading candidates are showing some worrisome weaknesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/is-pete-buttigiegs-version-of-hope-and-change-enough-to-take-on-trump">Continue reading...</a>

Divided Cities: inside the new documentary series from Guardian Cities
<p>Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more divided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these divisions in surprising and troubling ways<br></p><p>Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p><p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html">now there are 15</a>. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/06/divided-cities-inside-the-new-documentary-series-from-guardian-cities">Continue reading...</a>
‘Make Spain great again’: does Melilla really need a Trump-style wall? – video

John Bercow: ‘I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic’
<p>What next for John Bercow – Speaker for 10 years, and a household name thanks to Brexit? One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>

Not all Africans’ sacrifice is forgotten | Letters

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak.

Divided Cities: inside the new documentary series from Guardian Cities
<p>Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more divided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these divisions in surprising and troubling ways<br></p><p>Thirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical divisions, seemed to herald a more united future.</p><p>Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more divided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-border-wall-berlin-migration-human-rights-immigration-borders-a8624706.html">now there are 15</a>. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/nov/06/divided-cities-inside-the-new-documentary-series-from-guardian-cities">Continue reading...</a>
‘Make Spain great again’: does Melilla really need a Trump-style wall? – video

John Bercow: ‘I may be pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic’
<p>What next for John Bercow – Speaker for 10 years, and a household name thanks to Brexit? One thing he knows is that it won’t be Strictly…</p><p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month – in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise – the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p><p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It’s not only that he’ll have to get the voice right (at his best – or worst, depending on your point of view – Bercow sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g" title="">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that’s the easy part (“Order, orr-duu-rrr!”). It’s the personality that’s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he’s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he’s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I’ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/10/john-bercow-interview-i-may-be-pompous-but-i-am-completely-authentic">Continue reading...</a>

Is Pete Buttigieg’s version of ‘hope and change’ enough to take on Trump? | Geoffrey Kabaservice
<p>The 37-year-old mayor from Indiana has his vulnerabilities, but has become a contender for the presidency in just a few months</p><p>On a November evening a dozen years ago, Barack Obama – who at the time was the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois – <a href="https://granta.com/how-obama-won/">appeared at the annual fundraising dinner-rally</a> of the Iowa Democratic party, at which all of the 2008 Democratic presidential contestants were given about 10 minutes to speak. Obama came in as underdog to the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but delivered such a barn-burning stemwinder of a speech that he left as the favorite. A little more than three months later, he won the Iowa caucuses – the first major contest on the US presidential campaign calendar – and the rest is history.</p><p>None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who spoke at <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/02/candidates-entertain-and-fight-attention-crowded-liberty-and-justice-celebration-des-moines/4134936002/">last week’s</a> Iowa Democratic party Liberty and Justice Celebration pulled off an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/02/liberty-justice-celebration-des-moines-iowa-democrats-obama-biden-warren-sanders-beto">Obama-level breakout performance</a>. But the one who came closest was Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg hewed closely to the Obama playbook in making a case for his candidacy, and his Iowa speech seems likely to boost him in the polls at just the moment when the other leading candidates are showing some worrisome weaknesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/is-pete-buttigiegs-version-of-hope-and-change-enough-to-take-on-trump">Continue reading...</a>
